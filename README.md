# hackmotion_test_assignment

My Golf App is a Flutter-based application for inspecting recorded golf swings. I've written it as a test assignment to Hackmotion.
It features a Home Screen listing all swings and an Inspection Screen for detailed metrics.

Project structure:
• lib/
• models/: Data models (swing_model.dart).
• repositories/: Data fetching (swing_repository.dart).
• screens/: Main screens (home_screen.dart, inspection_screen.dart).
• widgets/: Reusable widgets (app_bar_widget.dart, header_widget.dart, chart_container.dart, navigation_button.dart, swing_chart.dart).

## Installation

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/my_golf_app.git

   ```
3. Install dependencies:
